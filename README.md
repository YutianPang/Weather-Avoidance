# Data Output
x train is basically a list of 100 by 100 matrix<br/>
y train is 1 by 6 which is the coords of three waypoints colored in red, green and blue. <br/>
An additional csv file is used to save start and end waypoint information.<br/>
# More 
The dashed line is the trajectory and the solid line is the planned trajectory. <br/>
One can find the start and end point based on the waypoint sequence. <br/>
